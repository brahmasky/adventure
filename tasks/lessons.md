# Lessons — orchestration mistakes and the rules that prevent them

Rules Claude writes for itself after corrections. Review at session start.

## Monitors / background watches

- **Compute watch windows from the real clock, never eyeball a timestamp.** (2026-07-04, Paco:
  "looks like your monitor didn't pick it up automatically?") A ledger watch was armed with a
  hardcoded `occurred_at > 04:00` boundary while the actual clock was ~03:30 — the awaited
  `self_write_published` (03:31) fell inside the excluded gap and the monitor waited forever on an
  event that had already happened. Rule: derive boundaries with `date -u` at arm time, AND make the
  watch's first iteration able to see an event that fired *before* arming (query from a boundary in
  the past, or explicitly check current state at arm time). A monitor that can't detect
  "already done" reports silence, and silence looks like "still waiting".
- **The user often completes interactive circuits faster than the watch cycle.** Twice on
  2026-07-04 Paco finished send→merge→reload before the orchestrator noticed. Verify current state
  FIRST (git log, ledger tail) before telling the user what to do next.

## Hermeticity (recorded in memory, repeated here)

- Non-hermetic tests (asserting env-var defaults without deleting the var) silently red-fail
  Houge's self-write test-gate and block ALL self-writes. Every new env var gets pinned in
  default-asserting suites (the PINNED_ENV pattern).

## Test design for a self-evolving agent

- **Never pin a code-owned user-facing string as a test literal** — existing tests are immutable
  to self-writes, so a pinned literal makes that string permanently un-self-writable (2026-07-03:
  Houge's header rename was structurally impossible until the literal moved behind an exported
  constant). Assert via exported constants.
